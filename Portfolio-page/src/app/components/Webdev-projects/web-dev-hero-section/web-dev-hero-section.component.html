      <h1>How I learned to code</h1>
      
      
      <p>I was always interested in technology. It all started with building ecommerce sites using WorldPress. I soon released
      that a CMS isnâ€™t enough to create everything I wanted to.
      </p>
      
      <p>I took my first beginner web-developer online course and I felt I really enjoy writing code and create what is in my
      mind. Now after I completed more than 100 hours of top courses and I spent plenty of hours exercising what I learnt, I
      am confidently able to work on frontend development projects and create websites just like this one, or more complex.</p>
